Process legal queries in natural language.
Access a database of court and administrative board decisions.
Provide recommendations based on case law and tax laws.
Generate automated reports and standard operating procedures (SOP).
Importance of Tax Compliance
Tax compliance is essential to ensure that companies comply with their tax obligations, both primary and accessory, mitigating the risk of penalties12. Implementing compliance practices helps prevent financial problems and complications with regulatory agencies, especially in a country with a complex tax system like Brazil23.
